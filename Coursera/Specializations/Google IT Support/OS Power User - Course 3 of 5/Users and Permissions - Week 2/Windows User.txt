8. File Access and Permissions:
In Windows, 'files and directory' permissions are assigned using Access Control Lists or ACLs. 
Specifically, we're going to work with Discretionary Access Control Lists or DACLs.
'Windows files and folders' can also have System Access Control Lists or SACLs assigned to them. 
SACLs are used to tell windows that it should use an "event log" to make a note of every time someone accesses a file or folder. 

Home directory in windows means: C:/User/xyz

File permission:
Read: The Read permission lets you see that a file exists, 
and allows you to read its contents. It also lets you read the files
 and directories in a directory.

Read and Execute: the Read and Execute permission lets
you read files, and if the file is an executable, you can run the file. 
Read and Execute includes Read, so if you select Read and Execute, 
Read will automatically be selected

List folder contents: List folder contents is an alias for Read and 
Execute on a directory

Write: the Write permission lets you make changes to a file.
It might be surprising to you, but you can have write access to 
a file without having read permission to that file. The write permission 
also lets you create sub directories and write two files in the directory. 

Modify: the Modify permission is an umbrella permission that include read, execute and write. 

Full control: a user or group with full control can do anything they want to the file. It includes 
all of the permissions of Modify, and adds the ability to take ownership of a file and change its ACLs. 

Command:-----
>> icacls
- to know in details about the file permissions

>> icacls C:\Users\ahmed\Documents
- will let you know about the file permission of this location.

10. Windows Modifying Permissions:
Goto specific folder or file. Then
properties -> security -> Edit -> Add -> write the user name(click check name to sure youruser name) 
-> check on the box below to access the permission you want to give to that user -> Apply and you are done.

Guest users: This is a special type of user that's allowed to use the computer without a password. 
Guest users are disabled by default. You might enable them in very specific situations.

Command:-----
>> icacls C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads
- to see the permission it has for different users.

>> icacls 'C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads\Video' /grant 'Everyone:(OI)(CI)(R)' [important]
- to give to permission to READ file to everyone

>> icacls 'C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads' /remove Everyone
- remove the permission you gave for everyone

>> icacls 'C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads' /grant 'Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(R)'
- I just want the people that have passwords on the computer to be able to see them. 
In that case, I want to use authenticated users group. That group doesn't include guest users.

10. Windows Special Permission:
Simple permissions are actually sets of special, or specific permissions.
We're going to let users WD, or create files like data, AD, create folders and append data, and S for synchronize.
